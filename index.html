        <p>Appliance Tracker (work in progress) will help users to keep track of who is using household appliances in real time, as well as who's next in line to use them.</p>
        <p>Users will be able to create accounts with Apple or Google credentials, make groups with other users, and make appliances.</p>
        <p>When it's someone's turn to use an appliance, they'll be sent a push notification.</p>

      <p>I've worked with numerous clients to build web and mobile applications for their businesses. Details below.</p>

        <p>For two years I worked with another developer to build a mobile podcast streaming service from the ground up: Neobyte.</p>
        <p>The other developer was also the founder and my mentor, and his teachings continue to be invaluable to this day.</p>
        <p>At Neobyte I had the opportunity to implement features and fixes on a huge variety of full stack issues, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>User interface design and navigation using React Native with Expo</li>
          <li>API development with tRPC</li>
          <li>User authentication, sign-in with Apple and Google, JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</li>
          <li>Integrating multiple servers and databases (SQL and Elasticsearch)</li>
          <li>Dependency injection patterns</li>
          <li>...and many more!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I had a lot of fun with those challenges.</p>

        <p>Tenzing Memo was in the very early stages of my career, and as such I was mainly there to learn.</p>
        <p>Through weekly agile meetings I discovered how developers meet business needs with technological solutions.</p>
        <p>For example, Tenzing Memo was also in its early stages at the time I joined. The business needed to get it's core product, an AI-driven stock market analysis tool, into the hands of customers as quickly and effectively as possible.</p>
        <p>The lead developers then opted to build the web application using Ruby on Rails for it's quick and agile development process.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we used Python to interface with the core ChatGPT scripts to deliver and manipulate the data.</p>
        <p>I had the opportunity to build a route that generated downloadable documents based on user queries, which I also wrote unit tests for.</p>

        <p>By the time I was accepted to work for and contribute to Aayats, I had enough knowledge to learn and develop in a new framework (Flutter)</p>
        <p>The development team for this application was much larger than teams I had worked on before, 14 developers in total while I was there.</p>
        <p>The business was a very early stage startup and wanted to ship both a web application and a mobile application as it's core products.</p>
        <p>I had the opportunity to lead a team of myself and two other developers to build the end-to-end systems for updating user info, real-time chat, and user settings. I also proposed and implemented a local containerized database solution to make the development process more clean and efficient across a larger team.</p>

        <p>I got offered a contract to add some features to Flirt, a mobile dating app that was a work in progress.</p>
        <p>The founder had tested his unique idea for a dating app on some college campuses with success and needed some independent contributors to add features before he was ready to ship the minimum viable product.</p>
        <p>At Flirt I had the opportunity to develop user interfaces involving displaying the profiles of potential matches to users across various screens.</p>
        <p>One of the interesting challenges here was state management, particularly involving date times.</p>
